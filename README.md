# Publication-Ready ROC Curves

This repository provides code for publication-quality ROC curves. It is built on the `ggplot` and `ggROC` packages.

The plots it renders resemble the ones used in this paper (_pending: link to proof-of-concept deep learning implementation, chest x-rays_).

This repository does NOT deal with ROC curve theory or ROC curves' mathematical properties.

I included a toy dataset in the `./data/` folder, with a Ground-Truth column (‘gt’), and two classifiers with continuous outputs (‘pred1’, ‘pred2’).
