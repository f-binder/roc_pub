# Publication-Quality ROC Curves

This repository provides code for publication-quality ROC curves. It is built on the `ggplot` and `ggROC` packages.

The plots it renders resemble the ones used in this paper (link).

This repository does NOT deal with ROC curve theory or ROC curves' mathematical properties.

I included a small toy dataset in the ./data/ folder, with a GroundTruth column (‘GT’), and two classifiers with continuous outputs (‘pred1’, ‘pred2’).
